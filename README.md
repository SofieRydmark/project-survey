# Survey form with React

This week we were to create a survey i React to

✓ Learn how to use the 'useSate' hook in React.
✓ How to connect HTML form inputs to state.
✓ How to use form fields with React
✓ How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

## The problem

I started with going through material and understanding how the useState() works with the help of the lectures and example projects. 
If I had more time I would add more questions and/or play around with different kinds of input type and the styling of those. I would also add validation errors.
